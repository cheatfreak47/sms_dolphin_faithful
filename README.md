# Super Mario Sunshine "Faithful" Dolphin Texture Pack
### A Fork of Qashto and Razius' SMS UHD Texture Pack
	
This fork omits a lot of textures in the original pack in service of remaining faithful to the original look of the game, and includes several entirely different textures from alternative sources. Not to offend the original texture pack creators, of course, but some of the textures are simply not to my taste.

In addition, the pack has been restructured entirely, more or less. This was for my own purposes while organizing things for the most part.

This pack is well suited to being used for playing the game in any resolution, although I myself have only used it at 1080p. Like the original, this texture pack is availiable in both PNG and DDS format- although, like with the base texture pack, it is recommended you use DDS if possible, as PNG is quite heavy on VRAM usage.

If you enjoy this pack, cool. I'm glad.
